# NLP_Transformer
Transformers are deep learning architectures designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like language translation and text generation. They uses a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies within input sequences. In this article, we’ll implement a Transformer model from scratch using TensorFlow.
